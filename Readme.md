# Sampling_Assignment

Following 5 sampling Techniques were used:
1. Random Sampling
2. Systematic Sampling
3. CLustered Sampling
4. Weighted Sampling
5. Stratified Sampling


Following 5 models were applied on the sampled dataset:
1. AdaBoostClassifier
2. RandomForestClassifier
3. KNeighborsClassifier
4. Support Vector Classifier(SVC)
5. RidgeClassifier


On execution of the code, following results were obtained:
The cells of the table represent accuracy of the applied model using the respective sampling technique.
